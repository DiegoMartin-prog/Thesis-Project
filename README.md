# Thesis Project: Non-Local Self* Image Denoising

This repository contains all the files that will contribute to my thesis project on deep learning and computer vision.

The problem I am trying to tackle in this project is the creation of a self-supervised, image denoising, deep learning algorithm that tries to exploit the non-localself-similarity prior to effectively denoise images and which is trained only on single noisy realizations of those.
